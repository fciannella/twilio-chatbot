# Recent Changes to Fraud Notification Agent

## Summary of Updates

### ✅ Simplified Identity Verification
- **REMOVED**: SMS verification codes, phone verification, 6-digit codes
- **NOW**: Simple name verification only
  - Agent asks: "For security purposes, can I please have your first and last name?"
  - Accepts first name, last name, or full name
  - Case-insensitive matching
  - No waiting for SMS or codes

### ✅ Improved Context Tracking
- Increased default conversation history from 40 to 50 messages
- Full conversation context is saved and restored across turns
- Agent remembers previous exchanges and can reference them
- Better continuity in multi-turn conversations

### ✅ Better Unclear Response Handling
- When user says gibberish or unclear responses, agent politely asks to repeat
- Example responses:
  - "I apologize, I didn't catch that clearly. Could you please repeat your first and last name?"
  - "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Could you say that again?"
- Prevents agent from getting stuck or making assumptions

### ✅ Enhanced System Prompt
- Clear step-by-step conversation flow
- Explicit instructions to ONLY ask for name (no phone numbers or codes)
- Instructions for handling unclear responses
- Emphasis on context awareness and memory

## Updated Conversation Flow

1. **Introduction**: "Hello, this is the fraud prevention team..."
2. **Identity Verification**: "For security purposes, can I please have your first and last name?"
3. **Handle Unclear**: If gibberish → politely ask to repeat
4. **After Verification**: Share fraud details, explain actions taken
5. **Customer Confirmation**: Ask if they recognize transactions
6. **Resolution**: Explain next steps (new card, disputes, credits)
7. **Close**: Answer questions, provide tips, mark as notified

- `+447911123456` → "Sarah Williams" or "Sarah" or "Williams"
